    "Neck Pain": {
      lead: "Tech-neck from long days at a desk, a bad night's sleep, or a pinched nerve — neck pain quietly limits how freely you turn, look, and rest. We assess the joints, muscles, and nerves involved, then restore pain-free motion at the source.",
      treat: ["Chiropractic Care", "Active Release Technique", "Dry Needling", "Physical Therapy"]
    },
    "Lower Back Pain": {
      lead: "The most common reason patients come to see us. From muscle strain and poor lifting mechanics to disc irritation, we identify what's actually driving your back pain and treat the cause — not just mask the symptom.",
      treat: ["Physical Therapy", "Chiropractic Care", "Shockwave Therapy", "Graston Technique"]
    },
    "Sciatica": {
      lead: "Sharp, radiating pain down the leg — often with numbness or tingling — usually traces back to nerve compression in the lower spine. We work to decompress the nerve, calm the irritation, and rebuild the stability that keeps it from returning.",
      treat: ["Chiropractic Care", "Physical Therapy", "Active Release Technique", "Deep Tissue Laser Therapy"]
    },
    "Sports Injuries": {
      lead: "From weekend warriors to competitive athletes, we treat sprains, strains, tendinopathies, and overuse injuries — and guide a safe, confident return to the field, the court, or the gym.",
      treat: ["Active Release Technique", "Shockwave Therapy", "Physical Therapy", "Therapeutic Taping"]
    },
    "Shoulder Pain": {
      lead: "Rotator cuff irritation, impingement, and stiffness make overhead movement painful and weak. We restore mobility and rebuild strength so you can reach, lift, and train without compensating.",
      treat: ["Physical Therapy", "Active Release Technique", "Dry Needling", "Shockwave Therapy"]
    },
    "Herniated Disc": {
      lead: "A bulging or herniated disc can press on nearby nerves, causing pain, weakness, and limited movement. Our conservative, non-surgical approach focuses on decompression, stabilization, and a gradual return to activity.",
      treat: ["Chiropractic Care", "Physical Therapy", "Deep Tissue Laser Therapy", "Active Release Technique"]
    },
    "Headaches & Migraines": {
      lead: "Many headaches actually start in the neck — driven by tension, posture, and joint restriction. We address the cervical spine and surrounding muscles to reduce how often headaches hit and how hard.",
      treat: ["Chiropractic Care", "Active Release Technique", "Dry Needling", "Massage Therapy"]
    },
    "Knee Pain": {
      lead: "Ligament and tendon injuries, post-op recovery, and overuse pain all limit how you walk, squat, and play. We rebuild strength, control, and confidence around the joint so it holds up under load.",
      treat: ["Physical Therapy", "Shockwave Therapy", "Graston Technique", "Therapeutic Taping"]
    },
    "Pre & Post-Op Rehab": {
      lead: "Going into surgery stronger leads to a smoother recovery — and structured rehab afterward rebuilds range, strength, and function. We support you on both sides of a procedure with a clear, progressive plan.",
